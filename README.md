## Project Ideas

### Beginner Level

1. **Feature Importance with Decision Trees**
   - **Objective**: Train a Decision Tree model and visualize the feature importance.
  
2. **Basic LIME Explanations**
   - **Objective**: Implement LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) to explain individual predictions of a simple classifier.

### Intermediate Level

1. **SHAP Values for Model Interpretation**
   - **Objective**: Use SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to explain the output of a Random Forest model.
   
2. **Explaining Neural Network Predictions**
   - **Objective**: Train a neural network on a dataset and use LIME and SHAP to explain its predictions.
  
### Advanced Level

1. **Explainable AI Dashboard**
   - **Objective**: Develop an interactive dashboard that provides model predictions and explanations using LIME and SHAP.
  
2. **Comparative Analysis of XAI Techniques**
   - **Objective**: Compare the effectiveness and insights provided by different XAI techniques (e.g., LIME, SHAP, Integrated Gradients) on complex models.
  
3. **Implementing Custom XAI Methods**
   - **Objective**: Develop and implement a custom XAI method tailored to a specific model or application.
